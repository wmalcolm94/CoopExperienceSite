    <h2>About Skyjack Inc.</h2>
    <p>
        Skyjack is one of many subsidiaries of the Linamar Corporation.  
        However, they are the only one that does not manufacture car parts, they build scissor lifts, vertical mast lifts, 
        telehandlers and booms. Skyjack is one of the leading brands in scissor lifts around the world. 
        Being a part of such a big company was an amazing experience. So amazing in fact, 
        that I decided to do spend my last three co-op terms there.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
        One of the learning goals I had at Skyjack was to come up with better solutions to more complicated problems. 
        I decided to set this goal for myself because I was looking back at the application I had made over my first term at Skyjack, 
        and kept noticing algorithms I had made to solve certain problems, that worked, but I felt I could do better. So I wanted to try. 
        I believe that I achieved this goal, because every new application I developed was better than the last, 
        and I was able to design and develop the next one more efficiently than the previous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another one of my goals was to create larger scale applications that can communicate with some of the larger business process 
        applications built by the other developers and applications that are outsourced. 
        I achieved this goal by working with the data cleansing task mentioned later on, which was really cool to do a larger scale database job,
        as databases seem to be something that I excel at. <br/>
        Another way I achieved this goal was to work with some of the applications that were outsourced to bigger software development companies.  
        I worked on some additions to an API created by another Skyjack developer to contact the giant production database which was an Advantage database, 
        and created some new features in the API so I could use them in various applications I was building.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet another goal I had for myself was to try to improve my time management skills to more effectively complete the projects I'm working on.
        At all times I had a list of projects I was working on, and when items in these projects needed to be completed.  
        One of the ways I achieved this goal was to try and have weekly meetings with people from each project to give them a status update on the progress that had been made since the last meeting.  
        I found this method very effective, and will hopefully continue to use it after school.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last goal I had for myself was to improve my limited knowledge of website development.  One of the ways I did this at Skyjack, 
        was to work on the various API's that were used in the company to connect to outsourced applications. 
        This helped to improve my knowledge of sending data through the internet to a database, and how that whole interaction works behind the scenes. 
        However, I did not get a whole lot of front end web development experience, which in turn, is why I decided to actually build a website for this report instead of just doing a word press site.

    <h2>Job Description</h2>
    <p>
        My job as an Application Developer Co-op was to design and develop applications to help solve business problems within the company. 
        This provided me with a unique opportunity to develop good requirements gathering techniques, 
        since the traditional customers who would be purchasing the application, were actually my co-workers. 
        This meant that I had easy access to customer feedback and they could easily follow along the progress that I was making on their application.
    </p> 
    <p>
        The other part of my job was developing the application. 
        To do this, I used the Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) to build Desktop Applications for users. 
        The WPF apps are built with C# to create the functionality of the application, xaml to design the user interface, 
        and a SQL Server, or SQLite backend based on the requirements of the application. 
        WPF also encourages the use of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, 
        which as you can probably guess is very similar to the Model View Controller design patter, 
        where the ViewModel functions similarly to the Controller. 
    </p>
    <p>
        During my first term at Skyjack I started by working with the Health and Safety manager, and his co-op student, 
        to reinvent the way they completed Workplace Insepctions around the two plants located in Guelph. 
        At the time they just had an excel file that they entered all of their findings into. 
        I still remember the first demo that the other co-op student and I did for the manager, 
        he was so excited and wanted to start using it immediately. Unfortunately for us, 
        it was still in the early stages of design at that time, so we still had some work to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the end of the first term, I had completed development on the Workpalce Inspection Application, 
        and lots of people were actually using to complete their Workplace Inspections, this was an amazing feeling, 
        to have spent 4 months working on a single project and by the end have something that could benefit a lot of people in an organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        My second term at Skyjack started off really well.  I actually found out that SQLite had a lot of concurrency problems with data access. 
        So my first task during this term was to convert my SQLite database to Sql Server.  This was a really neat experience, 
        and it made me realize that not all SQL languages are the same.  The whole conversion process took me a few days, as I had to recreate the database, 
        with all of the table relationships, and then import all of the data that had been entered into the application in the four months since I had worked there.
    </p>
    <p>
        After I completed the database migration, the next phase in the health and safety project was to build an Audit application.  
        This Audit appliation was built with the same tools as the Workplace Inspection.  However it started with a Sql Server backend, 
        and connected to the same database as the Workplace Inspection app.  It also began on a WPF template that one of the other developers at Skyjack made.
        This exponentially increased the development time.
    </p>
    <p>
        My third term at Skyjack consisted of a Data Migration project not tied to the Health and Safety project.  
        This data migration included mapping and massaging skyjack data from a corporate database to import into Skyjack Specific tables.  
        I separated out all of the tables, and moved our skyjack specific data to their own tables. 
        Once this was completed and verified by the production and quality departments, 
        I edited the Sql Server Integration Services (SSIS) package to use the new skyjack tables.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this I started the last two parts of the Health and Safety project.  This included a Incident Report application, 
        which again would be added to the same database, and use another version of the template to speed up the development time and add new nice to have features.
        This application also included a graphing portion that could map the number of incidents that occured to the various drop downs in the application, 
        within a specified date range.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last part of the Health and Safety project that I completed was an Admin Overarching type of Application.  
        It let the user search for a specific person, date range, plant, or location in a plant, 
        and let the user see everything that had occurred in either of the applications with to what ever filter they specified.
        This was something that management was very pleased with and would help organize their reporting a lot.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoyed my time at Skyjack very much and had an amazing time putting together the Health and Safety project.  
        The atmospehere at Skyjack was awesome and I really felt as though I was a part of the IT department, not just a regular co-op student.
        I would definitely consider working at Skyjack full time if a position becomes available in the future!
