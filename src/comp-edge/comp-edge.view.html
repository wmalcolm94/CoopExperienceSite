    <h2>About Competitive Edge Information Systems</h2>
    <p>Competitive Edge Information Systems Inc. is a very small company consisting of three full time employees (which included myself) and one contract employee.  The area of computer science that Competitive Edge deals with is database programming; the company builds and maintains record keeping software for various companies around Canada.  This software is custom made to maintain tables for customers, sales, suppliers, purchase orders, etc. and can also print out month end and summary reports for each aspect of the program. Despite being such a small company, Competitive Edge has some large clients, including Pepsi Co., SPCA, and the Canadian Federation of Podiatric Medicine (or CFPM for short). CFPM is the software for many foot clinics in Canada. This seems very unique to me since most of the clients that Competitive Edge gains are through word of mouth from other clients, or are clients gained through the CFPM organization, and for such a small company to have such big clients, I thought this was very impressive.</p>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>One of my goals for this work term was to gain a complete understanding of Microsoft Access.  I believe that I’ve achieved this, since I made modifications to several pieces of software that Competitive Edge has released previously, and also I built one on my own. Another one of the goals I set for myself during my placement was to become fluent in the VBA programming language and this goal was accomplished by maintaining and building software at Competitive Edge. I was very pleased to work with Microsoft Access and use it to learn about databases and the many ways that they are used in our day to day lives.  It was a new concept for me, and I had always found it very interesting but never entirely knew how they worked, but my time at Competitive Edge has changed that and I’m looking forward to using this new knowledge where ever I can.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview of Job</h2>
    <p>My job at Competitive Edge Information Systems was the Junior Software Developer.  This meant that I had a wide range of duties depending on what projects were currently going on at the company.  My duties included, but were not limited to, developing code and applications for new projects, testing code that had been built by other developers, modifying existing pieces of software, and designing various reports for the current system I was working on.  This is a picture of a customer find form in the same application as above, followed by the customer screen. Some of the most interesting parts of this job were that whenever I finished a project, the next day I would start working on something completely different.   One day I would finish an application I was modifying for a company that builds garage doors.  This application would take a set of numbers to use for calculations that would then be carried out in code, and print out all of the measurements needed to produce a certain model of door, with the exact specifications entered in by the user; then the next day I was designing an inventory and customer management system for a flooring company. Most of the skills that I needed for this job as a Junior Software Developer at Competitive Edge were learned on the job by solving customer support issues and debugging/modifying customer software.  A few of these skills include knowledge of how databases worked, and how to use Microsoft Access and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications to manipulate these databases.  Some of these skills included learning the various types of relationships that databases can have, and how to use them properly.</p>

    <h2>How does this job relate to your academic studies?</h2>
    <p>This co-op job had a lot of qualities that directly apply to my studies at University.  It helped me learn how to develop a large software application, when the only thing I was given to base the software on was a specification for the program.  This will be very applicable to my studies because most software that we will be building in the future, will not be short little programs that only take you a short amount of time to complete.  They will be bigger projects with several files and possibly being worked on by multiple people depending on the class that the software is being built for. Another reason that this job was very applicable to my studies at the University of Guelph is because there is a third year course called Data Base Systems and Concepts.  From the sounds of the name this is a beginner’s level introduction to databases and their applications in the computing world.  Seeing as my entire time at Competitive Edge was working with databases and manipulating them to suit the exact specifications of the clients, I feel I will likely have covered at least most if not all of this material already, despite not having started the third year of my degree at this time.</p>

    <h2>Focus of the Report:</h2>
    <p>The focus of this report would be the piece of software that I built for a flooring company in downtown Kitchener.  It took me almost a month and a half to put together.  I attended meetings that included my supervisor and the client to determine the requirements for the software.  I spent most of the day after that meeting with my supervisor planning how exactly we would build the code to work to the specifications of the client.  Next, I spent countless hours writing code, then testing it to make sure it worked, plus adding in a new feature, and then testing again, and repeating until the finished product.   After that I forwarded the application to my supervisor for more testing, and then was given a small list of errors that needed to be fixed.  This process repeated itself once, and then the software was demonstrated to the user.  The user is currently using this software to keep track of their inventory to make sure that they always have enough product to meet customer demand. The software is also used to keep track of all the customers that the company has so that they can keep track of orders, view receipts and print out reports for current or previous orders.  The software also manages the suppliers of the company, and the purchase orders that the company makes to their suppliers.  There are also various reports forms where a variety of reports (including customer lists, supplier lists, purchase order reports, purchase order lists, inventory lists, etc.) can be printed or previewed.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read the website I have created about my time at Competitive Edge Information Systems.  I had a great experience working there and making this website, and I hope you had some fun living through my eyes even if it was only for a brief time.</p>
