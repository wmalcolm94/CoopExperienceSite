    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I am a fourth year Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph.  I have just completed my fifth and final coop term at Skyjack Inc, working as an Application Developer.  Most of the work that I have done during my co-op terms has focused on a mixture of database design and development, as well as C# development. 
        Over my five co-op terms I have also done a lot of requirements gathering work as well, involving meeting with customers off and on, to gather the original requirements for the app that will be developed, and also gaining user feedback after a demo or live application has been delivered.
        All of my co-op terms have helped me to move from the traditional procedural way of looking at programming, to a more Object Oriented view.

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
        I would just like to thank Corey, and Justin, my bosses at Competitive Edge Information Systems, and The Guelph Family Health Team, respectively.  
        I would also like to thank the entire IT Department at Skyjack, for showing me how just a few people can make an entire national organization run seemlessly.
