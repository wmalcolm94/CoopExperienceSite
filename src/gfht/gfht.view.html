    <h2>About The Guelph Family Health Team</h2>
    <p>The Guelph Family Health Team is a fairly large company in the primary health care industry.  While employed at the company, I was a General Programmer and maintained the existing web application that the nurses and clinicians used on a daily basis to record their patient encounters, and lots of other things as well. A few interesting facts about my employer would be that my boss, is a previous Guelph BComp Grad.  The Guelph Family Health Team also has multiple clinics all over the city of Guelph.  The Guelph Family Health Team is not a giant business by many standards however they are the largest family health team in all of Ontario.  Therefore, they tend to be the trend setters for rules and guidelines for many family health teams, which is one of the reasons people buy the use of the FHTStats website from the Guelph Family Health Team.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I had four or five goals for this work term.  Most of the goals I developed were related to my job task.  One of my goals was to learn more about the medical technology jargon the team used daily.  One example was during a meeting I attended during the first or second week there, and most items discussed went right over my head.  Another one of my goals was to greatly improve my knowledge of the SQL language.  I achieved that goal by doing a lot of work writing stored procedures and writing queries to pull data for reports in the website.  Some of the technologies that I wanted to work with were Visual Studio and SQL Server.  I got to work with both of these technologies because the code for the website was all done in Visual Studio, and everything to do with the database was all in SQL Server Management Studio.</p>
    
    <h2>Job Description</h2>
    <p>My job was to provide technical assistance through a ticketing system.  This system was where all family health team staff using the website could submit their tickets.  I could also add modules and fix bugs that were found in the FHTStats.net website, which was managed internally at the Guelph Family Health Team.  All of this included writing new modules in C# and ASP.NET to provide the interface for the data, and use SQL Server to pull data from the database, or write newly entered information into the database (which could be pulled later). I think the most interesting part about my job was learning how the C# code and the SQL Server database worked together to provide one seamless web application.  The code that was written for it was superb and very easy to follow and understand what was going on.  Learning how to use it to execute Stored Procedures that were written in SQL through the C# website, was really interesting.</p>

    <h2>How Does This Job Relate To Your Academic Studies</h2>
    <p>This job relates to my academic studies because it involved learning how to use and modify a database if necessary.  Also, the entire website was all built through code in C# which is very similar to java which I will be doing some code in this semester.  I also learned a few ways to help C# and SQL work together to create an absolutely amazing website, that traffics a lot of data everyday, and seems to work very well.</p>

    <h2>Focus of the Report</h2>
    <p>Computer Science plays a humongous role in the business world that most people don’t even realize.  Almost every business that collects information needs some computer scientist to manage all of their data, or to design a program/website to input information into a database, and pull that same information into a report later.  Alternatively, the businesses need a computer scientist to design a program to keep track of everyone’s time worked, vacation booked off, etc just to keep all of the information in one centralized place for admin staff to verify staff hours worked, or when their staff are taking time off.  I believe that the demand for computer scientists will only continue to grow as the business world’s need for technology continues to increase.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>I feel that one of the most important things I learned at this job was how to use SQL Server Management Studio to manipulate a database. On top of that, I learned how to use Visual Studio and C# to connect to that SQL Server database and manipulate information in the database through a GUI.</p>
